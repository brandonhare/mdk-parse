figure out unknown data:
	dti arena num
	mesh reference points purpose
	textures a, b, flags
	sni sound type values
	unknown mesh material -1028
	other mesh material types
traverse other output? splines? scripts? reports?
traverse unused meshes/textures?
hide backface outlines
fix shiny z-fighting
calculate exact sky and shiny offsets
fall3d animation fps
fall3d dedup shared assets
fall3d move non-mesh textures out of mesh folder
make texture holder return full frames and path by ref
check bsp translucency tree ordering
store bsp geometry and don't bake to a mesh right away
split parse and export code somewhere else
export 3d animations inside meshes
unify export filenames for palettes and stuff
